_mod idea_ <br>
> Rather than bullet, shoot life.

Player shoot life, loose some of their. If the notBullet hit the target (other player), the target gains life. <br>
Need to change the UI > replace it with HEART. HEART float above the player's tank. <br>

_potential(ly bad) ideas_ <br>
1. players have to press [button] to keep (/feed) the light. Light progressively fade away. 
2. when one player dies, the game don't stop = passage du jour et de la nuit. The game that keeps on forever. Leaving the winning player to contemplate the "corpse" of the other tank. 
3. same as above, but it simply changes to night time. As players loose life = progression of the day. 
4. shoot paint to see? (see The Unfinished Swan) 
5. snow environment, difficulty to see ahead.
6. Real time lighting system (see https://answers.unity.com/questions/201499/how-to-get-the-system-time.html) <br>
> No fight during [period] day and/or time - no fight during even number (example) 
> Seasons? - no fight during [season] (example)
7. pay 1 life to have light around you/ to see something.

>Check system time
Create lights according to time. Add snow = winter, leaves = automn.. <br>
En ajoutant des contraintes et des éléments supplémentaires au jeu, il serait possible de créer une variété d'environnement/ de conditions, affectant directement le gameplay (ex. aucune possibilité de combat entre xtemps et ytemps, et/ ou durant une saison en particulier). Ça créerait des situations "anti-jeu", ou le jeu est simplement restraint par ces conditions.

_unrealated note_

As a silly joke (_easter egg?_), I named the enemy prefab (and anything related to them) "handDarkness", as a reference to Ursula K. Le Guin's novel "The Left Hand of Darkness". Even the cutout image is left-handed. Nothing in the game ever refer to the novel at all; This was mostly for my own personal enjoyment.

Ce lundi, cette grande dame s'est éteinte, laissant un immense vide dans l'univers de la littérature de science-fiction. Cette nouvelle ébranle mon petit coeur de libraire. Maintenant, j'espère cette infime référence rend, d'une certaine manière, hommage à cette  extraordinaire autrice. _And, if you haven't yet, please go read one of her novels._
