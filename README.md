_mod idea_ <br>
> Rather than bullet, shoot life.

Player shoot life, loose some of their. If the notBullet hit the target (other player), the target gains life. <br>
Need to change the UI > replace it with HEART. HEART float above the player's tank. <br>

_potential(ly bad) ideas_ <br>
1. players have to press [button] to keep (/feed) the light. Light progressively fade away. 
2. when one player dies, the game don't stop = passage du jour et de la nuit. The game that keeps on forever. Leaving the winning player to contemplate the "corpse" of the other tank. 
3. same as above, but it simply changes to night time. As players loose life = progression of the day. 
4. shoot paint to see? (see The Unfinished Swan) 
5. snow environment, difficulty to see ahead.
6. Real time lighting system (see https://answers.unity.com/questions/201499/how-to-get-the-system-time.html) <br>
> No fight during [period] day and/or time
